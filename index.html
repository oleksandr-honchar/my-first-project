      Rent vs Buy Dashboard for Poland
    </h2>
    <p>
      This dashboard for the Polish real estate market is designed to assist
      investors and others in analyzing apartment prices to make informed
      decisions between renting and buying.
    </p>
    <p>
      The data comes from a dataset featuring apartment sales and rental
      listings from Poland's 15 largest cities, including Warsaw, Lodz, Krakow,
      Wroclaw, Poznan, Gdansk, Szczecin, Bydgoszcz and Lublin. The data contains
      detailed information on city, apartment size, number of rooms, price (sale
      or rent), floor level and proximity to the city center.
