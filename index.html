      <p>
        This dashboard for the Polish real estate market is designed to assist
        investors and others in analyzing apartment prices to make informed
        decisions between renting and buying.
      </p>
      <p>
        The data comes from a dataset featuring apartment sales and rental
        listings from Poland's 15 largest cities, including Warsaw, Lodz,
        Krakow, Wroclaw, Poznan, Gdansk, Szczecin, Bydgoszcz and Lublin. The
        data contains detailed information on city, apartment size, number of
        rooms, price (sale or rent), floor level and proximity to the city
        center.
